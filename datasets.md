## Output Area to Postcode Sector (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between output areas and enumeration postcode sectors as at 31 December 2011 in England and Wales. The 2011 OA to enumeration postcode sector (E&W) lookup has been created from a base file, namely the residential postcode (census enumeration only) to 2011 OA lookup. The base file was created by best-fitting postcodes to 2011 OA by plotting the postcode centroid (the point of the mean address in the postcode) into the 2011 OA. To create a 2011 OA to postcode sector lookup from the base file, the following processes were run: - postcodes were truncated to five characters (postcode sector level) from seven characters (unit postcode level). - these five character postcode sectors were grouped to form a postcode sector to OA lookup (many postcode sectors to many OA). - each unique OA was then assigned to a single postcode sector. If an OA covered more than one postcode sector, the postcode sector with most Census population falling in the OA was assigned. This gives a one OA to many postcode sectors lookup. Postcode sectors can cross administrative areas and will only be aligned within the defined postcode hierarchy. (File Size 3MB).Field Names – OA11CD, PCDS11CD

## Output Area to Ward to Local Authority District (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between Output Areas (OA), wards and local authority districts (LAD) as at 31 December 2011 in England and Wales. This lookup has been provided with a 'small population indicator' field. This field indicates those wards which have a very small population. There are two designated categories to describe the changes, - 0 - normal population, - 1 - very small population. Where a ward is smaller than an OA and therefore does not contain any OA population weighted centroids, the ward is allocated to the OA with its population weighted centroid nearest to any part of the ward. Information on the percentage of an OA’s population that falls into the higher geography has also been included in this best-fit lookup file. This ‘best-fit percentage' indicator has been calculated by working out the percentage of the OA’s population that falls exactly within the output geography. In the case of the OA to Ward lookup three OAs have a 0% of their population in the ward to which they are allocated. The affected OA are E00071944, E00120017 and E00026547, and all are the result of the wards not aligning with the 2001 OAs. The OAs with less than 100% of their population within their allocated ward are because of the process of 'best-fitting' by which they were allocated. Each OA was assigned to a single ward on the basis of its population weighted centroid. This meant that for statistical purposes, an OA had all of its counts assigned to that ward, even if the reality was that the geographic area may have covered several wards. This is why the 'percentage best-fit match' was created - the percentage of an OAs actual population that fell within its allocated ward rather than the total population of the OA that is used for statistical purposes. This was designed to help statistical users better understand the best-fitting process.

## Output Area to Parish to Local Authority District (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between Output Areas (OA), civil parishes / communities and local authority districts (LAD) as at 31 December 2011 in England and Wales. This lookup has been provided with a 'small population indicator' field. This field indicates those parishes / communities which have a very small population. There are two designated categories to describe the changes, and these are as follows: - 0 - normal population, - 1 - very small population. Where a parish / community is smaller than an OA and therefore does not contain any OA population weighted centroids, the parish / community is allocated to the OA with its population weighted centroid nearest to any part of the parish / community. The methodology used to create the OA lookups is based on the distribution of 2011 Census population. A median average of each OA's household grid references, weighted by the population at each household has been used to create a population weighted centroid for each OA. This centroid has been used to allocate the OA and all its associated statistics to any higher geographies.

## Output Area to Workplace Zone to Local Authority District (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A lookup file between Output Areas (OA), Workplace Zones (WZ) and local authority districts (LAD) as at 31 December 2011 in England and Wales. This lookup has been provided with an 'indicator' field, that define the lookup between 2011 OA and WZ. There are four designated categories to describe the changes, and these are as follows: - E - Where an OA is the same as a WZ. - S - Split. This is where the OA has been split into two or more WZ. There will be one record for each OA that has been split into a WZ. - M - Merged. This is where two or more OA have been merged to form a WZ. - X - The relationship between the OA and the WZ is irregular and fragmented. There are instances where an OA has not exactly matched to a WZ. This is where the OA may have been either split then merged or merged then split, but into fragments that do not allow exact joining between OA and WZ. The constraints on WZ creation were to ensure a minimum of 100 workers and three workplace postcodes, and to constrain within MSOA. The 'X' code indicates it was not possible to meet these constraints and to create WZ purely through splits or mergers of OA.

## Output Area to LAU2 to LAU1 to NUTS3 to NUTS2 to NUTS1 (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between Output Areas (OA) to Nomenclature of Territorial Units for Statistics (NUTS) and Local Administrative Units (LAU) as at 31 December 2011 in England and Wales. The NUTS areas (Levels 1, 2 and 3) are operative as at January 2006 and the LAU areas (Levels 1 and 2) are operative as at January 2010. The methodology used to create the OA lookups is based on the distribution of 2011 Census population. A median average of each OA's household grid references, weighted by the population at each household has been used to create a population weighted centroid for each OA. This centroid has been used to allocate the OA and all its associated statistics to any higher geographies. Information on the percentage of an output areas population that falls into the higher geography has also been included in this best-fit lookup file. A ‘best-fit percentage’ indicator has been included in this lookup, to support an understanding of the actual relationship between the OA and the higher geography to which it has been best-fitted. This ‘best-fit percentage' indicator has been calculated by working out the percentage of the OA’s population that falls exactly within the output geography's boundary. This is calculated by plotting the grid references of the households into the output geography's digitised boundaries and aggregating the population that actually falls within the best-fitted geography's boundary. 100 indicates that all the OA's population actually fell within the best-fitted boundary. A value of 90 means that the OA's boundary is split across the output geography's boundary and that 90% of the OA's population actually fell within the geography the OA was best-fitted to. Only the higher geography to which the OA has been allocated will be given a percentage match.

There will be one record for each of the 2011 OAs that the 2001 OA has been split into. This means direct comparisons can be made between estimates for the single 2001 OA and the estimates from the aggregated 2011 OAs. - M - Merged. 2001 OAs have been merged with another one or more 2001 OAs to form a single 2011 OA. This means direct comparisons can be made between the aggregated 2001 OAs’ estimates and the single 2011 OA’s estimates. - X - The relationship between 2001 and 2011 OA is irregular and fragmented. This has occurred where 2001 OAs have been redesigned because of LAD boundary changes, or to improve their social homogeneity. These can’t be easily mapped to equivalent 2011 OAs like the regular splits (S) and merges (M), and therefore like for like comparisons of estimates for 2001 OAs and 2011 OAs are not possible. Each 2001 OA with an ‘X’ code is best-fitted to a 2011 OA by plotting the 2001 OA’s centroid into a 2011 OA boundary. However, this does not imply an exclusive 1:1 relationship with a 2011 OA, as it will also have a relationship with fragments of other 2011 OAs; the lookup is provided here so that all 2001 OA are included in the lookup.

## Output Area to Primary Care Organisation to Strategic Health Authority (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between Output Areas (OA), strategic health authorities (SHA) and primary care organisations (PCO) in England and local health boards (LHB) in Wales as at 31 December 2011. The methodology used to create the OA lookups is based on the distribution of 2011 Census population. A median average of each OA's household grid references, weighted by the population at each household has been used to create a population weighted centroid for each OA. This centroid has been used to allocate the OA and all its associated statistics to any higher geographies. Information on the percentage of an OAs population that falls into the higher geography has also been included in this best-fit lookup file. A ‘best-fit percentage’ indicator has been included in this lookup, to support an understanding of the actual relationship between the OA and the higher geography to which it has been best-fitted. This ‘best-fit percentage' indicator has been calculated by working out the percentage of the OA population that falls exactly within the output geography's boundary. This is calculated by plotting the grid references of the households into the output geography's digitised boundaries and aggregating the population that actually falls within the best-fitted geography's boundary. 100 indicates that all the OA population actually fell within the best-fitted boundary. A value of 90 means that the OA boundary is split across the output geography's boundary and that 90% of the OA population actually fell within the geography the OA was best-fitted to. Only the higher geography to which the OA has been allocated will be given a percentage match.

## Output Area to Westminster Parliamentary Constituency to European Electoral Region (December 2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between Output Areas (OA), Westminster parliamentary constituencies and European electoral regions (EER) as at 31 December 2011 in England and Wales. A ‘best-fit percentage’ indicator has been included in this lookup, to support an understanding of the actual relationship between the OA and the higher geography to which it has been best-fitted. This ‘best-fit percentage' indicator has been calculated by working out the percentage of the OA population that falls exactly within the output geography. This is calculated by plotting the grid references of the households into the output geography and aggregating the population that actually falls within the best-fitted geography. Only the higher geography to which the OA has been allocated will be given a percentage match. The other higher geographies that the OA shares its population with are not included in the best-fit lookup, and so will not be given a ‘best-fit percentage' indicator. The only exception to this will be those higher geographies, designated as having a ‘small population’. These are certain geographies that are smaller than an OA and therefore do not contain an OA population weighted centroid. For completeness of coverage, these geographies are included in the lookup based on a manual allocation of an OA to the geography, and will therefore also be given a percentage match of the OA population to the geography. Due to the nature of the OA design, and administrative area realignment, there are some OA which have low or no population in the higher geography to which they have been allocated. This is the result of the distribution of the population within certain OA, but they should still be allocated to higher geographies based on their population weighted centroid, in line with the Geography Policy for National Statistics and to keep the methodology for the production of best-fitted statistics consistent.

## Output Area to National Assembly for Wales Constituency to National Assembly for Wales Electoral Region (December 2011) Lookup in Wales

A best-fit lookup between output areas and National Assembly for Wales constituencies (NAWC) and National Assembly for Wales electoral regions (NAWER) as at 31 December 2011 in Wales. The methodology used to create the OA Lookups is based on the distribution of 2011 Census population. A median average of each OA's household grid references, weighted by the population at each household has been used to create a population weighted centroid for each OA. This centroid has been used to allocate the OA and all its associated statistics to any higher geographies. Information on the percentage of an output areas population that falls into the higher geography has also been included in this best-fit lookup file. A ‘best-fit percentage’ indicator has been included in this lookup, to support an understanding of the actual relationship between the OA and the higher geography to which it has been best-fitted. This ‘best-fit percentage' indicator has been calculated by working out the percentage of the OA’s population that falls exactly within the output geography's boundary. This is calculated by plotting the grid references of the households into the output geography's digitised boundaries and aggregating the population that actually falls within the best-fitted geography's boundary. 100 indicates that all the OA's population actually fell within the best-fitted boundary. A value of 90 means that the OA's boundary is split across the output geography's boundary and that 90% of the OA's population actually fell within the geography the OA was best-fitted to. Only the higher geography to which the OA has been allocated will be given a percentage match (File Size 1MB).

## Lower Layer Super Output Area (2001) to Lower Layer Super Output Area (2011) to Local Authority District (2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup between lower layer super output areas as at December 2001 and lower layer super output areas and local authority districts as at December 2011 in England and Wales. This product has been provided with a 'change indicator' field, that define the lookup between 2001 and 2011 LSOA. This field indicates which output areas / super output areas have changed between 2001 and 2011. There are four designated categories to describe the changes, and these are as follows: - U - No Change from 2001 to 2011. This means that direct comparisons can be made between these 2001 and 2011 LSOA. - S - Split. This means that the 2001 LSOA has been split into two or more 2011 LSOA. There will be one record for each of the 2011 LSOA that the 2001 LSOA has been split into. This means direct comparisons can be made between estimates for the single 2001 LSOA and the estimates from the aggregated 2011 LSOA. - M - Merged. 2001 LSOA have been merged with another one or more 2001 LSOA to form a single 2011 LSOA. This means direct comparisons can be made between the aggregated 2001 LSOAs’ estimates and the single 2011 LSOA’s estimates. - X - The relationship between 2001 and 2011 LSOA is irregular and fragmented. This has occurred where 2001 LSOA have been redesigned because of local authority district boundary changes, or to improve their social homogeneity. These can’t be easily mapped to equivalent 2011 LSOA like the regular splits (S) and merges (M), and therefore like for like comparisons of estimates for 2001 LSOA and 2011 LSOA are not possible. Each 2001 LSOA with an ‘X’ code is best-fitted to a 2011 LSOA by plotting the 2001 LSOA’s centroid into a 2011 LSOA boundary. However, this does not imply an exclusive 1:1 relationship with a 2011 LSOA, as it will also have a relationship with fragments of other 2011 LSOA; the lookup is provided here so that all 2001 LSOA are included in the lookup (File Size 2.7MB).
