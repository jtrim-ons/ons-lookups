## Output Area to Local Authority District to Lower Layer Super Output Area to Middle Layer Super Output Area to Local Enterprise Partnership (April 2017) Lookup in England V2

A lookup between Output Areas (OA), Lower Layer Super Output Areas (LSOA) and Middle Layer Super Output Areas (MSOA) at December 2011 and local authority districts (LAD) as at December 2016 and local enterprise partnerships (LEP) in England as at April 2017. Due to the overlaps in the LEP coverage of England, 4 LEP fields have been provided in the file - LEP17CD1/NM1 and LEP17CD2/NM2. The first two fields show the LEP that each OA falls into, allocated on a best-fit basis, the second two fields show the second LEP that the OA has been allocated to if it is contained in an overlapping LEP. This lookup includes: The newly enlarged local enterprise partnership of South East Midlands (E37000041).  This
