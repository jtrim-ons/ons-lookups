## Output Area (2001) to Output Area (2011) to Local Authority District (2011) Lookup in England and Wales

A best-fit lookup file between Output Areas (OA) as at December 2001 and OAs and local authority districts (LAD) as at December 2011 in England and Wales. This product has been provided with a 'change indicator' field that defines the lookup between 2001 and 2011 OAs. This field indicates which OAs / Super Output Areas (SOA) have changed between 2001 and 2011. There are 4 designated categories to describe the changes, and these are as follows: - U - No change from 2001 to 2011. This means that direct comparisons can be made between these 2001 and 2011 OAs. - S - Split. This means that the 2001 OA has been split into two or more 2011 OAs. There will be one record for each of the 2011 OAs that the 2001 OA has been split into. This means direct comparisons can be made between estimates for the single 2001 OA and the estimates from the aggregated 2011 OAs. - M - Merged. 2001 OAs have been merged with another one or more 2001 OAs to form a single 2011 OA. This means direct comparisons can be made between the aggregated 2001 OAs’ estimates and the single 2011 OA’s estimates. - X - The relationship between 2001 and 2011 OA is irregular and fragmented. This has occurred where 2001 OAs have been redesigned because of LAD boundary changes, or to improve their social homogeneity. These can’t be easily mapped to equivalent 2011 OAs like the regular splits (S) and merges (M), and therefore like for like comparisons of estimates for 2001 OAs and 2011 OAs are not possible. Each 2001 OA with an ‘X’ code is best-fitted to a 2011 OA by plotting the 2001 OA’s centroid into a 2011 OA boundary. However, this does not imply an exclusive 1:1 relationship with a 2011 OA, as it will also have a relationship with fragments of other 2011 OAs; the lookup is provided here so that all 2001 OA are included in the lookup.
