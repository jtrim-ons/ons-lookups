## Local Authority District to Combined Authority (December 2018) Lookup in England v2

A
lookup file between local authority districts (LAD) and combined authorities
(CAUTH) in England as at 31st December 2018. 


The names of
the combined authorities in this product reflect those that are in common use,
both within the areas and beyond. It should be noted that the names are not
always the same as the names in the Statutory Instruments that established
them. This is because the statutory names are often very long and not suitable
for the presentation of statistics.  (File Size - 16 KB) 

File updated to include the change to North East combined authority and the creation of North of Tyne combined authority
